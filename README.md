###Java swing application that computes physics variables  
###Program is very basic and is intended to help me practice interfaces and inheritance  
###Download link for example: [.zip Download](http://www.brandenkeck.com/res/downloads/Physics App.zip)  

##Relevant Ideas:  
###Use of CardLayout to change screens  
###Inheritance of JPanels to create layouts for the application's modules  
###Use of ImageIcon, JButton, JComboBox, and JTextField to create user inputs  
###Using logic to allow several calculation options based on user input
###Other basic object-oriented programming ideas
